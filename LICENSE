Below are the sources (in C and VHDL) implementing the pseudo-UART
allowing you to establish communication with your IP core simulated
in GHDL (http://ghdl.free.fr).
The simulated core is accesible via pseudoterminal (e.g. /dev/pts/11)
in Linux or similar system, just as it would be a real hardware
connected to real hardware port.
For details see "desc.txt" in attached archive.
All attached sources are PUBLIC DOMAIN. however I'd be glad if someone
using them provides information about original sources.
I'd be also glad to hear about people using this design and about any
improvements introduced by them.
